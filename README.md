# <span>C# 201:</span> Game Development
Material for the C# 201 Hy-Tech Club Course. This course uses [MonoGame](https://www.monogame.net/) to introduce game development in C# and introduce some C# programming concepts.

## New Concepts
Review the new concepts on the [Reference](Reference.md) page.

- MonoGame stuff (content, basic methods, screen, drawing, time, keyboard input)
- Velocity + Acceleration math
- `Texture2D` objects
- `Vector` objects
- `Rectangle` objects
- Properties
- Inheritance
    - Virtual/Override Methods
- Enumerations

## Two Options
- Self-paced
- Group-paced

## Parts
There will be a series of code-along activities, each building on the last. There will be written guides as well as videos. For the starting point of each activity (other than the "Hello World" activity), there will be a branch in the student-facing GitHub repository.

- Environment setup
- "Hello World" - make the player appear, loading in a Texture2D object, representing its position with a Vector and Rectangle
- Create the Player class
- Control the Player's movement
- Create the Projectile class
- Create the CoolDown class
- Allow the Player to fire Projectiles
- Create the Sprite class
- Make the Player and Projectile classes inherit from the Sprite class
- Create the Enemy class that should inherit from the Sprite class and fire projectiles
- Update the Enemy sprite image with Piskel
- Handle collisions between projectiles
    - Create the ProjectileType enum
- Create the EnemyColumn class
- Create the life count / score
- Create the screen cover
- Create the divider line
- Add animations
